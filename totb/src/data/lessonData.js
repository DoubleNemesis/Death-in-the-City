            Ok, I am gonna need your help! The record of who enters and leaves the building is kept locked
    up in a safe and I don't know the code. But maybe you will be able to work it out.
    </p>
    <p>
    To open the safe you need to use the right combination of letters. Each letter is the first letter of a verb.
    I don't know the verbs but I do know the nouns they collocate with. If I give you the nouns, perhaps you can work them out.
    So for example if the noun is "TV", the verb could be "watch", so you would take "W" and put it in the safe. Clear?
