            I first met Chey when he came into my clinic. He was having problems <input id={props.id1} name={props.name1} value={props.value1} onChange={props.onchange} /> his back.
            I diagnosed a serious slipped disk in his upper spine. When he lifts anything heavy he is cripled <input id={props.id2} name={props.name2} value={props.value2} onChange={props.onchange} /> pain.
            He probably sustained this injury by working out in the gym without warming <input id={props.id3} name={props.name3} value={props.value3} onChange={props.onchange} />.
            Although he looks strong, he is physically too weak to lift much more than a dinner plate. He should <input id={props.id4} name={props.name4} value={props.value4} onChange={props.onchange} /> alcohol
            - he is addicted <input id={props.id5} name={props.name5} value={props.value5} onChange={props.onchange} /> painkillers, and they don't mix.
